AutomateTechno
==============
This project is dedicated to automation of electronic music production and djing.  The only feature for now is a scriptable interface for Mixed In Key.

This is how to use it:

%ruby ./MixedInKeyInterface.rb <some_file.mp3>

It works by actually pretending to be a human user and actually clicking UI elements. So when you see a popup saying "Hands off", it means do not touch keyboard or mouse until it says "At Ease."
